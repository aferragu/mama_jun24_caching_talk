### Abstract:
Caching plays a crucial role in todayâ€™s networks: keeping
popular content close to users reduces latency. Timer-based
caching policies (TTL) have long been used to deal with
bursts of requests, and their properties are well understood.
However, in some scenarios the traffic is more regular. In this
work, we define a dual of the TTL policy, dubbed Timer-
based Pre-fetching, particularly well suited for these scenarios. 
We also show how the optimal timers can be computed
for a large class of request processes.
